<canvas data-processing-sources="/and/scripts/being/osp-frog.pde">With canvas enabled you would see a frog with a crown, constructed of two yellow vertexes.</canvas>

<p>In London, after <a href="http://www.sebastiensanfilippo.be/" title="Sebastien Sanfilippo's Portfolio">Seb</a> has explained <a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/seb-explaining-love-and-bezier-curves" title="I like tight pants and seb explaining love and bezier curves">love and bezier curves</a> to jenseits, <a href="http://www.oep-h.com/" title="OEP-H">Pierre</a> sets up a way to communicate with our <a href="http://www.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus" title="Scribus.net">DTP-software</a> via IRC chat. Seb starts to scribble coordinates, sends through a number of commands, and up on the beamer appears a stark re-imagining of the <a href="http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/" title="OSP &#8212; Open Source Publishing &#8211; Design Tools For Designers">OSP</a> logo.</p>

<p>Seb has made direct use of one of the basic principles in computer graphics: giving instructions to draw to a virtual canvas. As a graphic designer you are always using programs like Illustrator or <a href="http://inkscape.org/" title="Inkscape. Draw Freely.">Inkscape</a> to create these kind of instructions so it is refreshing to do so yourself.</p>

<p>This is the code used, adapted to <a href="http://processingjs.org/" title="Processing.js">Processing.js</a>:</p>

</p>

<p>This is easily my favourite logo in the world. It is for a computer program called <a href="http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/h-index.html" title="GNU Pascal">GNU Pascal</a> (a programming language in fact). To the left, we see a gnu. To the right, Blaise Pascal. Rather than trying to convey brand values through metaphor, the name is depicted in the most literal way imaginable.</p>

<p>It’s not just the literalness that is unusual. The use of this kind of figurative illustration in logos is rare. The only niche that springs to mind is <a href="/and/assets/called/HansTextiel.gif" title="">1970ies retail chains</a>.</p>

<p>Visual abstraction has becomes the norm in corporate branding since the post WWII period. In America, designers like <a href="http://www.paul-rand.com/foundation/identity/" title="Paul-Rand.com :: American Modernist :: 1914-1996">Paul Rand</a> and Saul Bass started to produce logos in flat colours and simple shapes that aimed to convey what the companies are about. It is this language that has stuck with us for logos ever since.</p>

<p>Even though it might be useful to convey a brand message that is clear and straightforward, there is an obvious limit to the benefits of abstraction. As the brand values a logo is supposed to express get exceedingly open ended (‘innovation’, ‘integrity’), it becomes more difficult to visually evocate them. That is how we end up with logos built around isometric cubes and moebius strips, and with <a href="http://www.salon.com/1999/11/30/naming/" title="The name game -   Advertising - Salon.com">company names</a> like Agilent and Avilant.</p>

<p>It is here that the literalness of GNU Pascal provides the counterbalance I look for. I heart the complete absence of symbolism. And the departure from traditional corporate marketing is all the more exciting because it rhymes with the product itself. GNU Pascal is open source software: it is changeable and redistributable at will. As such it is built more on the values of the academic world than on the traditional corporate ethos. And while visual identities for open source software tend to be pale imitations of corporate aesthetics, GNU Pascal is one clue of how such software could find a style of its own.</p>]]>

    <summary>Besides these people being engaged in intercourse, you might notice the programming book in the lower right corner, on C++.</summary>
    <author>
        <name>tellyou</name>
        
    </author>
    
    
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/">
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deckchair_sex_position.jpg">
  <img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/830/wide/and/called/User-Rama-Deckchair_sex_position.jpg" style="width:830;height:435;" alt="User-Rama-Deckchair_sex_position.jpg" title="" />
</a></p>

<p>On this picture, besides the main action, you might notice the programming book in the lower right corner, on C++. As such, this image unites two interests of its author, who is my favourite Wikipedia contributor: User:Rama.</p>

<p>User:Rama describes himself as: Physicist by training, scientist by vocation. He makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rama/Sexuality_drawings" title="User:Rama/Sexuality drawings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">his illustrations</a>, which he describes as fugly drawings, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatate">yatate</a>, a Japanese medieaval pen.</p>

<p>The style varies between the images. Though many are decidedly retro, this image close-up has a contemporary feel:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fellatio.jpg">
  <img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/830/wide/and/called/User-Rama-Fellatio.jpg" style="width:830;height:568;" alt="User-Rama-Fellatio.jpg" title="" />
</a></p>

<p>The style looks like <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=raymond+pettibon" title="raymond pettibon - Google Search">Raymond Pettibon</a>, an artist whom I adore. Music fans probably know his work through is album covers for Black Flag, and especially through his seminal record cover for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo_(album)" title="Goo (album) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Sonic Youth’s GOO</a>.</p>

<p>Pettibon’s style is known as ugly drawing. So the resemblance goes all the way through nomenclature. I’m not sure if Rama and Pettibon are aware of each others work though.</p>

<p>But I wonder, User:Rama, where are you now? Are you still on our team? Everything I know about you I found out through your <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Rama" title="User:Rama - Wikimedia Commons">user page</a>. But now it does not link anymore to the sexuality drawings, and it does not talk about the Yatate. Gone are also you displays of pride for Europe: you used to embed the European flag and the EU’s hymn, Ode to Joy. You used to make me feel so good about being European!</p>]]>

    <summary>Daniela likes tight pants. And she is ready to engage with the world of computer programmers. When a large group of open source software developers pass by our city, we grab our chance. </summary>

<p>Daniela likes tight pants. I guess that makes it easy for her to relate to our blog. As an art student, she is ready to <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 1">learn about unix</a>.</p>

<p>I tell Daniela that we are in luck, because this weekend, there is the largest gathering of open source computer programmers in Europe, <a href="/and/why-would-europes-largest-open-source-convention-identify-itself-with-a-large-shrivelled-brain" title="I like tight pants and why would europe’s largest open source convention identify itself with a large shrivelled brain?">Fosdem</a>. We go. I’m always scared to blend in too much at computer conferences like this so I put on a Lady Gaga t-shirt.</p>

<p>We plan to visit the final keynote speech because like this you experience a lot of people together. Plus, the topic tends to be of interest to a broader public. This year it is the Freedom box, a kind of mini server for your private data, the idea being that if everyone has such a box they can hook up together to create a more secure and more private social networking experience.</p>

<p>Tellyou is there too and he does some translating for us (‘what is Debian?’). We can relate to the topic even though the speaker does not seem to be to joyous. Daniela notices he mentions ‘community’ a lot. I think this is because in cyberspace, the community is less bound by place and more volatile so you have to stress it is actually there. The organising commitee comes on stage to provide both a song and a fosdem dance.</p>

<p>As we leave, Daniela asks me if I think they will succeed with the Freedom box. I think they will, up to a degree, and then the technology will be re appropriated and made popular by more business minded people.</p>

<p>It is really easy to add your own commands to Unix. Even a small script you write can be used in the same way as other unix commands. (Which is actually the reason Unix is a mess sometimes, because everybody went in and added their own commands.)</p>

<p>The reason it is so straightforward to create Unix programs is that you do not have to program or design a graphic user interface: everything runs from the terminal. This is part of programmer culture: <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1">like glit argues</a>, if you want to stay up to date with new exciting developments, you need to know how to run things from the terminal, because programmers are usually not going to take the time to create a graphical user interface for their latest experiments. Instead, they, will distribute it as a unix script.</p>

<h3>The interface</h3>

<p>Instead of letting the user manipulate buttons and text boxes, a unix program accepts arguments and options on the command line. Unix programs can also specify what to do with the text passed in by other programs via pipelines (standard input). And what almost every program does: they can output text to the terminal (standard output).</p>]]>

<p>After working through the <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 1">first</a> <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-2" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 2">two</a> <a href="/and/installing-compilers" title="I like tight pants and installing compilers">parts</a> of Absolute Beginners: Unix for Art Students <a href="/and/i-have-relocated-to-brussels" title="I like tight pants and i have relocated to brussels">Fabien</a> asked me how you can than actually use the terminal to make something. That is a good question. In <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 1">part 1</a> gilt writes that it is commendable to find a more intimate way of dealing with your computer, but that does not enter the question <em>what</em> you could be doing with your terminal. Taking cues from a <a href="http://schr.fr/hypermap" title="HYPERMAP | schr.fr">design installation</a> we developed for the Performance Studies International festival, I would like to show an example of using the command line to create graphic images, and the kind of design processes that it can accommodate.</p>

<h3>Building pipelines</h3>

<p>The unix command line is built around passing around text. Programs generate text, and other programs can take this as their input. You can start to create whole ‘pipelines’ of programs all connected together.</p>

<p>As our input today we take the <a href="http://twitter.com/jennyholzer" title="Twitter | Jenny Holzer">tweets of Jenny Holzer</a>. I do not know if you’ve heard of her, but Jenny Holzer is an artist who’s work prefigures contemporary social media: long before the advent of Facebook and twitter she has been claiming public space with her written truisms that, <a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/i-like-ziggy-over-zarathustra#jennyholzer" title="I like tight pants and ziggy over zarathustra">like habitus says</a>, always precipitate on the edge between worn clichés and individual confessions (<em>with you inside me comes the knowledge of my own death</em>).</p>

<p>Seeing how Holzer has built her oeuvre and her career around the logic of the status update since well before it existed, it was a small step for her to take her work to twitter.</p>

<p>Today we are not going to visit the twitter website, we are going to access it via the terminal. To get the latest tweet from Jenny Holzer we use the command:</p>

<pre>curl "http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/jennyholzer.json?count=1"</pre>

<p>The output will be something like:</p>

<pre>[{"coordinates":null,"truncated":false,"place":null,"geo":null,"in_reply_to_user_id":null,"retweet_count":36,"favorited":false,"in_reply_to_status_id_str":null,"user":{"listed_count":1572,"contributors_enabled":false,"lang":"en","profile_text_color":"000000","protected":false,"location":"","statuses_count":359,"profile_background_image_url":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/images\/themes\/theme1\/bg.png","name":"Jenny Holzer","default_profile":false,"profile_link_color":"D73030","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jenny_Holzer","utc_offset":-18000,"description":"Abuse of power comes as no surprise.","friends_count":0,"profile_background_color":"D73030","following":true,"profile_background_tile":false,"followers_count":37419,"profile_image_url":"http:\/\/a2.twimg.com\/profile_images\/25643062\/jenny_holzer_normal.jpg","default_profile_image":false,"geo_enabled":false,"created_at":"Wed May 30 19:07:47 +0000 2007","profile_sidebar_fill_color":"F0F0F0","profile_background_image_url_https":"https:\/\/si0.twimg.com\/images\/themes\/theme1\/bg.png","favourites_count":0,"is_translator":false,"show_all_inline_media":false,"follow_request_sent":false,"notifications":false,"profile_sidebar_border_color":"000000","profile_image_url_https":"https:\/\/si0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/25643062\/jenny_holzer_normal.jpg","screen_name":"jennyholzer","id_str":"6451032","verified":false,"id":6451032,"profile_use_background_image":false,"time_zone":"Eastern Time (US & Canada)"},"in_reply_to_screen_name":null,"created_at":"Fri Jan 13 15:34:55 +0000 2012","in_reply_to_user_id_str":null,"retweeted":false,"source":"\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/download\/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ETwitter for iPhone\u003C\/a\u003E","id_str":"157848105683922945","in_reply_to_status_id":null,"id":157848105683922945,"contributors":null,"text":"SEX DIFFERENCES ARE HERE TO STAY"}]</pre>

<p>Curl is a program that gets the contents of a document on the web, and prints it out to the terminal.</p>

<p>We have requested the status from twitters API, which is a way for twitter to present the data in a format that is more easy for computer programs to consume. It uses JSON format, which is great and all, but it’s just a little bit to new-fashioned for our means: we want plain old fashioned text.</p>

<p>To go from the JSON to the old fashioned text, we are constructing the first part of our timeline.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre>curl "http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/jennyholzer.json?count=1" | sed 's/.*"text":"\(.*\)"}]/\1/g'</pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre>SEX DIFFERENCES ARE HERE TO STAY</pre>

<p>The <code>|</code> symbol feeds the output from the curl command to the sed command. The exact arguments we are using for sed we will not go into today, because it is a bit daunting if you are just getting into this sort of thing, but it suffices to understand that sed manipulates it input so that everything but the little part inside text=" " is maintained.</p>

<p>Now we have the plain text as output, which we could use as input for another program. For example:</p>

<pre>curl "http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/jennyholzer.json?count=1" | sed 's/.*"text":"\(.*\)"}]/\1/g' | figlet</pre>

</pre>

<p>Now we have Jenny Holzer ascii art!</p>

<p>We are going to go a bit further with this. What we want to do is layout this plain text in such a way that we could display it or print it. For this we are going to use a program called pango-view. It comes as part of pango, which we will have to install:</p>

<pre>brew install pango</pre>

<p>In fact, pango-view, spoils the fun somewhat, because it doesn’t let you use it as part of a pipeline. We’ll have to store the Jenny tweet into a text file:</p>

<pre>curl "http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/jennyholzer.json?count=1" | sed 's/.*"text":"\(.*\)"}]/\1/g' > jennytweet.txt</pre>

<p>The <code>></code> lets you store text output into a file. So we are storing the output of are pipeline, the plain text tweet, into the file <code>jennytweet.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Pango-view lets us lay-out the text and output it as a picture:</p>

<pre>pango-view jennytweet.txt -q -o jennytweet.png</pre>

<p><img src="/and/assets/called/jennytweet-plain.png" style="width:353;height:39;" alt="‘SEX DIFFERENCES ARE HERE TO STAY’ set in pango-view’s default font" title="" /></p>

<p>If you type <code>man pango-view</code> you get an overview of the different options you have. <code>-q</code>, for example suppresses the default behavior to also display the result in a window.  <code>-o</code> specifies the output file, in this case jennytweet.png. Next to these two options, we also specify an <em>argument</em>, which is the inputfile to use. The program knows it is an argument instead of option, because it is not preceded by a dash and an option name.</p>

<p>In the man page, we read that we can use <code>--font</code> to specify a font. It does not tell you the format to do so, which is the name followed by the size:</p>

<pre>pango-view jennytweet.txt -q -o jennytweet.png --font "Futura 36"</pre>

<p><img src="/and/assets/called/jennytweet-banner.png" style="width:882;height:83;" alt="‘SEX DIFFERENCES ARE HERE TO STAY’ set in Futura" title="" /></p>

<p>By default, pango-view thinks in pixels. So the Futura will have an x-height of 36 pixels. If we don’t specify any measurement for the width, the text will by laid out on one line like a long banner, the width determined by the width of the text.</p>

<p>If we want to produce the look of a laid-out piece of text, we will have to specify a width:</p>

<pre>pango-view jennytweet.txt -q -o jennytweet-laidout.png --font "Futura 36" -w 400</pre>

<p><img src="/and/assets/called/jennytweet-laidout.png" style="width:553;height:146;" alt="‘SEX DIFFERENCES ARE HERE TO STAY’ set in Futura, laid out to a maximum width" title="" /></p>

<p>The cool thing about pango-view is that it can also generate vector files: pdf, but also svg and postscript. You just change the filename, and it does it automatically.</p>

<pre>pango-view jennytweet.txt -q -o jennytweet-laidout.ps --font "Futura 36" -w 400</pre>

<p>(Check out the resulting file in preview with <code>open jennytweet-laidout.ps</code>.)</p>

<p>Why postscript? Well, we have this really cool old-school postscript utility called poster. And we are going to use this to create a tiling version of the image we just created, that spans many sheets of paper. First install poster:</p>

<pre>brew update
brew install poster</pre>

<p>(You do no have the brew command? See tellyou’s post about homebrew). To generate a poster, you can do:</p>

<pre>poster -s 4.4 jennytweet-laidout.ps > jennyposter.ps</pre>

<p>The -s 4.4 scales our original image 4.4 times. The original image has no real size declared in cm, so I did not know beforehand how big the result was going to be. I just came up with this 4.4 value by trail and error.</p>

<p><a href="/and/assets/called/jennytweet-pages.png"><img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/490/wide/and/called/jennytweet-pages.png" style="width:421px;height:490px" /></a></p>

<p>Voilà. One can open this in preview and print it. Heck, one can even print it from the command line:</p>

<pre>lpr jennyposter.ps</pre>

<p>Let’s hang it on the wall.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>My hypothesis is that David Bowie succeeded where Friedrich Nietzsche failed.</p><p>20th century musicians like Bowie and Prince can be seen as to exemplify Nietzsche’s ideal of the ‘new philosopher’. They combine intellectual and spiritual lyrics with unprecedented style and music. Through means of mass communication and mechanical reproduction, their work has been able to resonate with an audience on a large scale. and take part in defining the cultural landscape.</p><p>In visual arts, Andy Warhol can be seen as such a new philosopher who shares recognition among artists, scholars, and the general cultural public. Indeed, Arthur C. Danto points to Warhol as the moment where art turns into philosophy.</p><p>In the present day, the means of reproduction and dissemination have shifted again because of the digital revolution.</p><p>Learning from Bowie, one could figure out what it was that made him so successful in articulating his sensibilities, and how his methodologies would translate to contemporary modes of production.</p><p>The goal is an art/design practice which:</p><ul>
<li>takes place on the nexus of pop culture and institutionalised art</li>
<li>is at the nexus of private introspection and public dissemination</li>
<li>readily explores all available technology in order to do so.</li>
</ul><p id="jennyholzer">Two more examples come to mind: Jenny Holzer, whose truisms always precipitate on the edge between worn clichés and individual confessions, and who claims public space through all media for these inward looking statements.</p><p>And Prince. Prince, when recording the vocals for the Sign o’ the times album, would do so in the control room of the studio, sending away all engineers after they prepared the session, leaving him alone with the microphone to sing. I am struck by the contrast between this highly inward looking ritual, and its imprint as an artifact that is reproduced literally millions of times.</p><h2>1: Why are Bowie and Nietzsche similar?</h2><p>In the early 1970ies David Bowie starts to refer to Friedrich Nietzsche in his lyrics, on both his albums ‘the Man Who Sold the World’ and ‘Hunky Dory’. In the song Quicksand he sings: I’m not a prophet or a stone age man, just a mortal with potential of a superman’. And: ‘Should I kiss the viper’s fang, and herald loud the death of man?’</p><p>The direct successor to these records, the 1972 ‘the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars’ seems to forego Nietzsche references for images of rock stardom. </p><p>In a way, though, this album is much more Nietzschean than its predecessors. </p><p>The narrative of a rockstar from space making it on earth before his eventual fall, can be seen as a more catchy instance of the supermen of the previous records. Moreover, the work can be directly compared to Nietzsche’s ‘Also sprach Zarathustra’ in which a prophet comes down from his cave to do his teachings to the public.</p><p>Both works can be read as thinly veiled autobiographies, where the choice of an unusual medium verse (Nietzsche) and rock (Bowie) allows the author to put in a lot of his ideas and fears and aspirations, that might otherwise have come across as megalomania or sacrilege. The process of mystification through the invention of the characters of Ziggy and Zarathustra allows the authors to take the freedom to reinvent themselves. Bowie later said: ‘it was like rewriting myself, really’. </p><h2>2: Why are Bowie and Nietzsche different?</h2><p>When looking back on the Ziggy project Bowie stresses the aspect of embracing the present:</p><p>“Writers like George Steiner had nailed the sexy term post-culture and it seemed a jolly good idea to join up the dots for rock. The main platform would be, other than shoes, ‘we are the future, now’ and the one way of celebrating that was to create it by the only means at our disposal. With, of course, a rock ‘n’ roll band.”</p><p>For Bowie the future was now. Whereas for Nietzsche the future was still clearly in the future. After writing Zarathustra he had conceded that his philosophy would not be read and appreciated in his own time. His subsequent book ‘Jenseits von gut und böse’ has as its subtitle: prelude to a philosophy of the future. He also thinks it will not be him that is going to fulfill philosophy’s potential. He sketches the need for ‘new philosophers’: ‘in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take NEW paths’.</p><p>Man of the future, acting in the present. An apt description of Ziggy.</p><p>The difference in self-image mirrors the difference in reception by their contemporaries. Bowie managed to find a massive crowd, Nietzsche never did during his lifetime. And although both men went through difficulties following the release of their seminal works, Bowie ended up on top. Nietzsche went insane.</p><h2>3: Why could Bowie do what Nietzsche could not?</h2><p>That Nietzsche had to leave for the future, what Bowie could achieve in his own time, can be attributed to several factors.</p><p>In the first place, Nietzsche was alone. And nobody can do anything alone.</p><p>We have already touched on the enabling role of modern mass media. This for me is exemplified by by the contrast between the highly inward looking ritual of the recording session, and its imprint as an artifact (the record) that is meant to be reproduced literally millions of times. Prince, when recording the vocals for the Sign o’ the times album, would do so in the control room of the studio, sending away all engineers after they prepared the session, leaving him alone with the microphone to sing. </p><p>Yet there is another important aspect: the rise of interdisciplinary practice.</p><p>Both men possessed (and in Bowie’s case still possess) a range of skills.</p><p>Bowie was skilled both with words and with music, and had experience as an actor. With the Ziggy project he added his own talents to these of a host of others in a decidedly transdisciplinary endeavour. Bowie contributed songs, words, voice and looks. The musicians, the producer and the engineer contributed further to the sound. The photographic look was crafted by Mick Rock, the suits were designed by a Japanese fashion designer, and even Bowie’s hair style was conceived especially for him by his hairdresser. The early shows were inspired by the ‘Exploding plastic inevitable’ multi media shows Warhol made with The Velvet Underground. The shows featured elaborate set designs, projections and a mime group.</p><p>Nietzsche apparently had a broad range of talents and interests as well. He was quite musical and wrote Lieder. Next to that, ‘Also Sprach Zarathustra’ is full of references to dance. In her book: ‘Nietzsche’s Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and the Revaluation of Christian Values’ Kimerer L. LaMothe argues that these references should not be seen as metaphors: dance was important to Nietzsche in its own right.</p><p>In his work, however, there was no way yet for these different media to fruition. It is just language that has to pull it off.</p><p>The world just wasn’t transdisciplinary yet in the 19th century. It would take the 20th century avant-garde to change that.</p><p>A question I would like to ask is if language alone could ever suffice for the kind of questions Bowie and Nietzsche were asking. There is a maniacal element to their thinking which I suspect can only really be sublimated in a performative setting. I know for my self, at least, that I talk better when I perform.</p>]]>

<p>The architecture here is great. Unlike, for example, Paris, where most buildings are larger apartment complexes, Brussels consists of “maisons de maitre”, large houses that were built by the bourgeoisie to house a family and their servants.</p>

<p>I live in such a house with a group of housemates. We are our own servants, so we use the food elevator to bring the meal we cook up from the kitchen to the salon. And on Sundays we debate who cleans the marble.</p>

<p>Figlet has proved to be a gateway drug for extended terminal usage. Figlet is not on your computer by default though. Even though your mac comes with a lot of unix software already, not a lot of it is graphics software. To install new software you need to install what is called a package manager, as explained in <a href="/and/installing-compilers">I like tight pants and installing compilers</a>. This article will continue with an introduction that tells you how to use the terminal!</p>

<p>In your Applications folder, choose Accessories, and open Terminal. Now you can talk with your computer. He can tell you who you are. Type:</p>

<pre>$ whoami</pre>

<p>(without the $ and the space, that’s just a convention to denote text that you enter into the terminal). And press enter. The computer outputs your username! The computer also knows where you are, at least where you are on the hard disk. Enter:</p>

<pre>$ pwd</pre>

<p>And the computer will repond with <code>/Users/yourusername</code>. It would make sense if you could say <code>whereami</code> but consistency is not Unix greatest strength. You are now in what is called your home folder.<br />
You can always return to your home folder by typing:</p>

<pre>$ cd</pre>

<p><code>cd</code> is also the commando to use to go to another folder. You can use the tab button to make this go quicker.<br/>
Type, by example:</p>

<pre>$ cd Do(tab)</pre>

<p>You will see</p>

<pre>Documents/ Downloads/</pre>

<p>Complete further to</p>

<pre>$ cd Doc(tab)</pre>

<p>And your line will be extended to form:</p>

<pre>$ cd Documents/</pre>

<p>When you push enter, you will arrive into the folder Documents. You can check this by again typing</p>

<pre>$ pwd</pre>

<p>To see what files are part of the folder you are in:</p>

<pre>$ ls</pre>

<p>You can also check this in the finder, if you want. You can use the terminal and the finder at the same time. This can make it easier to learn what is going on. You can launch the finder from the terminal.</p>

<pre>$ open .</pre>

<p><code>.</code> refers to the current folder. <code>open .</code> will open the current folder with the associated program, which is the finder.</p>

<p>To make a new empty file:</p>

<pre>$ touch my_text_file.txt</pre>

<p>If you still have the Finder open, you will see it appear! To open with the text editor:</p>

<pre>$ open mijn_tekst_bestand.txt</pre>

<p>These are the basics of navigating around the terminal.</p>

    <summary>To easily install new unix graphics software, you need a package manager. Homebrew is the best option for the Mac. For Homebrew you need to install a compiler, that&apos;s part of the lifestyle.</summary>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="/and/assets/called/absolute_beginners_homebrew.png"><img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/830/wide/and/called/absolute_beginners_homebrew.png" alt="You see a Macintosh OS X 10.6 desktop with the standard background, purple spacescape, the sole program open is the terminal program, showing the output of installing software through the homebrew package manager." title="" style="width:830px;height:518px;" /></a></p>

<p>We will install <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" title="Homebrew — MacPorts driving you to drink? Try Homebrew!">homebrew</a> to make it easy to install software. One of the upsides to installing homebrew is that you are also forced to install a compiler. A compiler is, <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1">like glit says</a>, part of this lifestyle: there are many other ways to install software than through homebrew, but most of them require a working compiler setup.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.kabk.nl/" title="Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (NL) | KABK">KABK</a> we installed Homebrow on a variety of Macs. The instructions differ slightly from version to version.</p>

<p>For homebrew, you need an Intel Mac with OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or newer. To install, we do as instructed on the website: there is a command</p>

<pre>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"</pre>

<p>Copy and paste it into a terminal window and press enter.</p>

<p>When the command has run, homebrew tells you to install XCode and Xquartz.</p>

<p>To download XCode for 10.5 or 10.6, you need to become a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/" title="Apple Developer">registered Apple Developer</a>. The site makes it look like you need to pay, but you can register for free.<br/>
For 10.5 you can download Xcode 3.1.4<br/>
For 10.6 can you download Xcode 3.2.6</p>

<p>For 10.7 you can download XCode 4.2 from the App store. This will put a program in your Applications folder that will install XCode. Run this too. Since this version of XCode doesn’t come with the time tested GCC compiler, and some software (such as ffmpeg) will refuse to compile on the newer compiler. That’s why you also need to install GCC, <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer#readme">available here</a> (“Pre-built binary”).</p>

<p>With <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases" title="Releases – XQuartz">XQuartz</a> you install a compatibility layer for Unix software that requires a graphical user interface. Follow the instructions on their website.</p>

<p>With all this installed, you can install your first unix software package: git</p>

<pre>brew install git</pre>

<p>Git is needed to keep your homebrew installation up to date. And now you are all set!</p>]]>
