        <![CDATA[<p>My hypothesis is that David Bowie succeeded where Friedrich Nietzsche failed.</p><p>20th century musicians like Bowie and Prince can be seen as to exemplify Nietzsche’s ideal of the ‘new philosopher’. They combine intellectual and spiritual lyrics with unprecedented style and music. Through means of mass communication and mechanical reproduction, their work has been able to resonate with an audience on a large scale. and take part in defining the cultural landscape.</p><p>In visual arts, Andy Warhol can be seen as such a new philosopher who shares recognition among artists, scholars, and the general cultural public. Indeed, Arthur C. Danto points to Warhol as the moment where art turns into philosophy.</p><p>In the present day, the means of reproduction and dissemination have shifted again because of the digital revolution.</p><p>Learning from Bowie, one could figure out what it was that made him so successful in articulating his sensibilities, and how his methodologies would translate to contemporary modes of production.</p><p>The goal is an art/design practice which:</p><ul>
<li>takes place on the nexus of pop culture and institutionalised art</li>
<li>is at the nexus of private introspection and public dissemination</li>
<li>readily explores all available technology in order to do so.</li>
</ul><p>Two more examples come to mind: Jenny Holzer, whose truisms always precipitate on the edge between worn clichés and individual confessions, and who claims public space through all media for these inward looking statements.</p><p>And Prince. Prince, when recording the vocals for the Sign o’ the times album, would do so in the control room of the studio, sending away all engineers after they prepared the session, leaving him alone with the microphone to sing. I am struck by the contrast between this highly inward looking ritual, and its imprint as an artifact that is reproduced literally millions of times.</p><h2>1: Why are Bowie and Nietzsche similar?</h2><p>In the early 1970ies David Bowie starts to refer to Friedrich Nietzsche in his lyrics, on both his albums ‘the Man Who Sold the World’ and ‘Hunky Dory’. In the song Quicksand he sings: I’m not a prophet or a stone age man, just a mortal with potential of a superman’. And: ‘Should I kiss the viper’s fang, and herald loud the death of man?’</p><p>The direct successor to these records, the 1972 ‘the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars’ seems to forego Nietzsche references for images of rock stardom. </p><p>In a way, though, this album is much more Nietzschean than its predecessors. </p><p>The narrative of a rockstar from space making it on earth before his eventual fall, can be seen as a more catchy instance of the supermen of the previous records. Moreover, the work can be directly compared to Nietzsche’s ‘Also sprach Zarathustra’ in which a prophet comes down from his cave to do his teachings to the public.</p><p>Both works can be read as thinly veiled autobiographies, where the choice of an unusual medium verse (Nietzsche) and rock (Bowie) allows the author to put in a lot of his ideas and fears and aspirations, that might otherwise have come across as megalomania or sacrilege. The process of mystification through the invention of the characters of Ziggy and Zarathustra allows the authors to take the freedom to reinvent themselves. Bowie later said: ‘it was like rewriting myself, really’. </p><h2>2: Why are Bowie and Nietzsche different?</h2><p>When looking back on the Ziggy project Bowie stresses the aspect of embracing the present:</p><p>“Writers like George Steiner had nailed the sexy term post-culture and it seemed a jolly good idea to join up the dots for rock. The main platform would be, other than shoes, ‘we are the future, now’ and the one way of celebrating that was to create it by the only means at our disposal. With, of course, a rock ‘n’ roll band.”</p><p>For Bowie the future was now. Whereas for Nietzsche the future was still clearly in the future. After writing Zarathustra he had conceded that his philosophy would not be read and appreciated in his own time. His subsequent book ‘Jenseits von gut und böse’ has as its subtitle: prelude to a philosophy of the future. He also thinks it will not be him that is going to fulfill philosophy’s potential. He sketches the need for ‘new philosophers’: ‘in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take NEW paths’.</p><p>Man of the future, acting in the present. An apt description of Ziggy.</p><p>The difference in self-image mirrors the difference in reception by their contemporaries. Bowie managed to find a massive crowd, Nietzsche never did during his lifetime. And although both men went through difficulties following the release of their seminal works, Bowie ended up on top. Nietzsche went insane.</p><h2>3: Why could Bowie do what Nietzsche could not?</h2><p>That Nietzsche had to leave for the future, what Bowie could achieve in his own time, can be attributed to several factors.</p><p>In the first place, Nietzsche was alone. And nobody can do anything alone.</p><p>We have already touched on the enabling role of modern mass media. This for me is exemplified by by the contrast between the highly inward looking ritual of the recording session, and its imprint as an artifact (the record) that is meant to be reproduced literally millions of times. Prince, when recording the vocals for the Sign o’ the times album, would do so in the control room of the studio, sending away all engineers after they prepared the session, leaving him alone with the microphone to sing. </p><p>Yet there is another important aspect: the rise of interdisciplinary practice.</p><p>Both men possessed (and in Bowie’s case still possess) a range of skills.</p><p>Bowie was skilled both with words and with music, and had experience as an actor. With the Ziggy project he added his own talents to these of a host of others in a decidedly transdisciplinary endeavour. Bowie contributed songs, words, voice and looks. The musicians, the producer and the engineer contributed further to the sound. The photographic look was crafted by Mick Rock, the suits were designed by a Japanese fashion designer, and even Bowie’s hair style was conceived especially for him by his hairdresser. The early shows were inspired by the ‘Exploding plastic inevitable’ multi media shows Warhol made with The Velvet Underground. The shows featured elaborate set designs, projections and a mime group.</p><p>Nietzsche apparently had a broad range of talents and interests as well. He was quite musical and wrote Lieder. Next to that, ‘Also Sprach Zarathustra’ is full of references to dance. In her book: ‘Nietzsche’s Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and the Revaluation of Christian Values’ Kimerer L. LaMothe argues that these references should not be seen as metaphors: dance was important to Nietzsche in its own right.</p><p>In his work, however, there was no way yet for these different media to fruition. It is just language that has to pull it off.</p><p>The world just wasn’t transdisciplinary yet in the 19th century. It would take the 20th century avant-garde to change that.</p><p>A question I would like to ask is if language alone could ever suffice for the kind of questions Bowie and Nietzsche were asking. There is a maniacal element to their thinking which I suspect can only really be sublimated in a performative setting. I know for my self, at least, that I talk better when I perform.</p>]]>

<p>This is Fabien. He is making his way through <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-2" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 2">part 2</a> of <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 1">Absolute Beginners: Unix for Art Students</a>. Fabien is an art student, in graphic design, at <a href="http://www.lacambre.be/" title=".: LA CAMBRE / ECOLE NATIONALE SUPERIEURE DES ARTS VISUELS :.">La Cambre</a>, the French speaking art academy in Brussels.</p>

<p>The architecture here is great. Unlike, for example, Paris, where most buildings are larger apartment complexes, Brussels consists of “maisons de maitre”, large houses that were built by the bourgeoisie to house a family and their servants.</p>

<p>I live in such a house with a group of housemates. We are our own servants, so we use the food elevator to bring the meal we cook up from the kitchen to the salon. And on Sundays we debate who cleans the marble.</p>

<p>If I type</p>

<pre>$ figlet absolute beginners</pre>

<p>into my terminal, this is what I get:</p>

<pre>       _               _       _       
  __ _| |__  ___  ___ | |_   _| |_ ___

</pre>

<p>Figlet has proved to be a gateway drug for extended terminal usage. Figlet is not on your computer by default though. Even though your mac comes with a lot of unix software already, not a lot of it is graphics software. To install new software you need to install what is called a package manager, as explained in <a href="/and/installing-compilers">I like tight pants and installing compilers</a>. This article will continue with an introduction that tells you how to use the terminal!</p>

<p>In your Applications folder, choose Accessories, and open Terminal. Now you can talk with your computer. He can tell you who you are. Type:</p>

<pre>$ whoami</pre>

<p>(without the $ and the space, that’s just a convention to denote text that you enter into the terminal). And press enter. The computer outputs your username! The computer also knows where you are, at least where you are on the hard disk. Enter:</p>

<pre>$ pwd</pre>

<p>And the computer will repond with <code>/Users/yourusername</code>. It would make sense if you could say <code>whereami</code> but consistency is not Unix greatest strength. You are now in what is called your home folder.<br />
You can always return to your home folder by typing:</p>

<pre>$ cd</pre>

<p><code>cd</code> is also the commando to use to go to another folder. You can use the tab button to make this go quicker.<br/>
Type, by example:</p>

<pre>$ cd Do(tab)</pre>

<p>You will see</p>

<pre>Documents/ Downloads/</pre>

<p>Complete further to</p>

<pre>$ cd Doc(tab)</pre>

<p>And your line will be extended to form:</p>

<pre>$ cd Documents/</pre>

<p>When you push enter, you will arrive into the folder Documents. You can check this by again typing</p>

<pre>$ pwd</pre>

<p>To see what files are part of the folder you are in:</p>

<pre>$ ls</pre>

<p>You can also check this in the finder, if you want. You can use the terminal and the finder at the same time. This can make it easier to learn what is going on. You can launch the finder from the terminal.</p>

<pre>$ open .</pre>

<p><code>.</code> refers to the current folder. <code>open .</code> will open the current folder with the associated program, which is the finder.</p>

<p>To make a new empty file:</p>

<pre>$ touch my_text_file.txt</pre>

<p>If you still have the Finder open, you will see it appear! To open with the text editor:</p>

<pre>$ open mijn_tekst_bestand.txt</pre>

<p>These are the basics of navigating around the terminal.</p>

    <summary>To easily install new unix graphics software, you need a package manager. Homebrew is the best option for the Mac. For Homebrew you need to install a compiler, that&apos;s part of the lifestyle.</summary>

    </author>
    
    
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/">
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="/and/assets/called/absolute_beginners_homebrew.png"><img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/830/wide/and/called/absolute_beginners_homebrew.png" alt="You see a Macintosh OS X 10.6 desktop with the standard background, purple spacescape, the sole program open is the terminal program, showing the output of installing software through the homebrew package manager." title="" style="width:830px;height:518px;" /></a></p>

<p>We will install <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" title="Homebrew — MacPorts driving you to drink? Try Homebrew!">homebrew</a> to make it easy to install software. One of the upsides to installing homebrew is that you are also forced to install a compiler. A compiler is, <a href="/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-1">like glit says</a>, part of this lifestyle: there are many other ways to install software than through homebrew, but most of them require a working compiler setup.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.kabk.nl/" title="Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (NL) | KABK">KABK</a> we installed Homebrow on a variety of Macs. The instructions differ slightly from version to version.</p>

<p>For homebrew, you need an Intel Mac with OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or newer. To install, we do as instructed on the website: there is a command</p>

<pre>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"</pre>

<p>Copy and paste it into a terminal window and press enter.</p>

<p>When the command has run, homebrew tells you to install XCode and Xquartz.</p>

<p>To download XCode for 10.5 or 10.6, you need to become a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/" title="Apple Developer">registered Apple Developer</a>. The site makes it look like you need to pay, but you can register for free.<br/>
For 10.5 you can download Xcode 3.1.4<br/>
For 10.6 can you download Xcode 3.2.6</p>

<p>For 10.7 you can download XCode 4.2 from the App store. This will put a program in your Applications folder that will install XCode. Run this too. Since this version of XCode doesn’t come with the time tested GCC compiler, and some software (such as ffmpeg) will refuse to compile on the newer compiler. That’s why you also need to install GCC, <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer#readme">available here</a> (“Pre-built binary”).</p>

<p>With <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases" title="Releases – XQuartz">XQuartz</a> you install a compatibility layer for Unix software that requires a graphical user interface. Follow the instructions on their website.</p>

<p>With all this installed, you can install your first unix software package: git</p>

<pre>brew install git</pre>

<p>Git is needed to keep your homebrew installation up to date. And now you are all set!</p>]]>

<p>Glit here. So maybe you read bnf’s latest article, and you can not make chocolate out of it. The <a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/vector-pixels" title="I like tight pants and vector pixels">little program</a> he writes, is a script that runs on the <a href="/and/the-voice-of-the-shell" title="I like tight pants and the voice of the shell">command line
</a>. You may have never used the command line before. You might not even want to. But I’m here to tell you it’s a smart move.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re an art student. And you just bought an expensive aluminium computer, because that’s part of the deal of being an art student today. What programs are you planning to run on it? Photoshop, Safari… Illustrator and inDesign maybe?</p>

<p>That’s so boring! There’s ways to be vastly more intimate and experimental with your computer, and since you have endeavored to study art and you want to be experimental and intimate with your materials, you better get at it with your computer too!</p>

<p>You couldn’t tell by the glossy graphics, but your Mac runs actually quite an old fashioned system, called Unix. Unix has been around since like forever. Or at least the 1970ies. Unix used to run on big computers in universities and enterprises, but in Mac Os X it has now found it’s way to personal computers.</p>

<p>Because Unix used to be the system that computer scientists and system administrators would run, almost all of the nifty programming tools have been developed for Unix. Your mac comes preinstalled with all the major programming languages: Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP. It comes with the webserver that runs many of the websites on the internet: Apache. And because it is a Unix system, you can easily expand with all the open source software that is being written today.</p>

<p>So here’s a sweet deal: your shiny expensive computer comes with a lot of programs for free, and you didn’t even know about it. Plus, you can tap into all the open source development that is being done right now. So whenever someone writes a new creative, clever or useful open source software tool, you can get that for free too! A whole new world to take in.</p>

<p>Now here’s the catch. Computer programmers and system administrators have a culture all of their own. One of the defining characteristics is, within this culture, graphical user interfaces like your Mac’s windows and buttons are not seen as the easiest way to deal with a program. Rather, you are expected to deal with your program through a <em>Terminal</em>. This is a window in which you type commands. Just like in DOS, for those of you who have used a computer before 1995.</p>

<p>So to benefit from the culture of open source and programming, you have to learn how to use the terminal to run your programs. Other than that, you have to learn to use a program called a ‘package manager’ to easily install new programs. My colleagues are going to learn you both of these things. And to achieve the latter, we’re also going to install a compiler—having a compiler around is an integral part of this lifestyle.</p>

<p>I’ll hand it back to bnf to <a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/absolute-beginners-unix-for-art-students-part-2" title="I like tight pants and absolute beginners: unix for art students – part 2">introduce you to the terminal!</a>.

</a> at the Piet Zwart institute, Rotterdam. One of the few master courses <a href="http://river-valley.tv/how-to-run-an-art-school-on-free-and-open-source-software/" title="How to Run an Art School on Free and Open Source Software | River Valley TV">that runs on free and open source software

<p><em>I like tight pants and mathematics.<br/>
Queering up programming culture.</em></p>

<blockquote>To give programming a productive place in your arts and design practice, you need to get to know programming culture, and, ideally, take part in (re)shaping it. To feel comfortable with being a programmer, you might want to change what a programmer is. With queering up I am not referring to homosexuality, but rather to an approach that undermines existing masculine, heteronormative ideals.  An historical example would be Glam rock’s appropriation of the traditional ‘earnest’ masculine rock musician into the polysexual identity mirror palace created by musicians as David Bowie and Freddy Mercury.</blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p>I tell my students that the command line is the way to go. I am not the kind of person who thinks the command-line is somehow a more true experience though—it’s another modality, another way of accessing and manipulating the data on your machine.</p>

<p>The query-response format is wonderful. I amaze students with the whoami command—the computer knows the answer! This gives the impression, to some, that the console allows you to have conversations with your computer.</p>

<p>I do often feel like I am talking to the computer. But when the computer talks balk to me, from time to time the voice of the computer gives way to the voice of the programmer who wrote it. Or at least, my image of this programmer. This is the output of a 7zip command:</p>

Everything is Ok</pre>

<p>I am moved by the program telling me everything is ok. I am not sure if Igor Pavlov meant to give me consolation from the console—after all, the sentence is logically equivalent to ‘there are no errors’. It could be a simple observation.</p>

<p>In any case it’s endearing: I imagine the programmer as a pretty dark-haired boy. He is shy and his eyes that hide already behind large glasses avoid your gaze. And Igor is not so handy with words, but he means good with the world. </p>

<p>But the encounter is not always so nice. The reason I install Fedora is because I have to compile some Perl modules to put on my shared hosting service to make Movable Type work (all of this takes place some time back). The interactive mode of CPAN has the most condescending error messages ever.</p>

<p>Yet nothing beats Telnet. When typing in RCPT: instead of the required RCPT TO: I get:</p>

<pre>Error: I can break rules, too. Goodbye.</pre>

<p>And my connection is closed. I feel like I can actually strangle the programmer responsible for this behaviour. The rude message is a catalyst for my negative passions. I imagine the programmer delighting in his sense of control over me and I want to smash the keyboard on his head.</p>

<p>I project in my mind this monster: crouched behind his computer, staring intently at the screen, a system administrator, overweight and unkempt hair, staring maniacally at the screen, laughing out loud about this error message that is going to upset the people using his code. But I have been awake too long. I made him in my own image; look at me: I’m also alone, staring maniacally at the screen, making up these stories about computer programmers.</p>

<p>With minds so volatile and temperaments so inflammable, it’s important we stay nice to each other. If the only way we talk to each other is through error messages, we better make these exceptionally kind.</p>

<p>For the shared exhibition of our <a href="http://www.dedcr.nl">studio complex</a> I want to show current work. But most of what I do is for the screen now. So I make a physical hyperlink to the blogosphere. I cut out 424 squares in sparkly adhesive and create the QR-code for the hyperlink to this very blog. Not every phone manages to scan it correctly—I’m not sure if it’s because the grid is slightly crooked, or because the glitter is confusing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img src="/and/assets/scaled/to/490/wide/and/called/cs61a.png" alt="You see a lecture hall from above. Computer code is projected above the blackboards that contain formulas. The professor stands behind his desk. Many students have computers. To the left one large student wears no shirt." title="" />

<p>I want to learn how to program. Why, that is for another post. But then where to begin. You can’t just learn programming, it seems, you have to pick one among many of programming languages to learn. And each programming language has a corresponding community. And these communities behave like football supporters for their own language. While they would be better pressed to support programming in general ’cause that’s a cause for which many new converts can still be made, and these converts don’t care for the particularities of your language—yet. Anyway, this turns me off.</p>

<p>So this sounds just right:</p>

<blockquote>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about any particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and query systems. To get past generalities you must have programming practice in some particular language, and in this course we use Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. This language is particularly well-suited to the organizing ideas we want to teach. Our hope, however, is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days’ work.</blockquote>

<p class="byline"><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/0.pdf" title="">source</a></p>

<p>I get the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html" title="Structure and Interpretation 
of Computer Programs">big blue book</a>, and I start watching the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/search?cx=005415252586317091923%3Anp2thtbsmyq&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=61a&amp;sa=Search&amp;siteurl=webcast.berkeley.edu%2F" title="UC Berkeley Webcasts | Video and Podcasts: Search Courses and Events">screencasts</a>. Parts of me get stimulated that I had forgotten I have. Like some kind of abstraction gland. It’s pretty nice.</p>

<img src="/and/assets/called/sicp_cover.jpg" style="width:400px;height:579px" alt="You see a blue book cover. The title reads, in white: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Over a read background, in black and white, a woodcut of two people engaged in alchemistic practice. Below, the authors read as Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman" title="" />

<p>But it’s also way too difficult. The way in which Abelson &amp; Sussman explain computation is by consistently comparing it to math. Math is probably a way of thinking in which Science majors are already comfortable. Yet I don’t do math on a regular basis. So it’s like teaching me a language I don’t know by comparing it to another language I don’t really speak either.</p>

<p>A different strategy is needed. I need to work with what I know: words, images. <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" title="Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years">Peter Norvig says</a> to use whatever your friends are using: “The advantage you get from learning from your friends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or between programming languages.” I’m gonna ask my friends to help me get started.</p>
