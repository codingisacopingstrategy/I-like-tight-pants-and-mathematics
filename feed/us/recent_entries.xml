<p>Glit here. So maybe you read bnf’s latest article, and you can not make chocolate out of it. The <a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/vector-pixels" title="I like tight pants and vector pixels">little program</a> he writes, is a script that runs on the <a href="/and/the-voice-of-the-shell" title="I like tight pants and the voice of the shell">command line
</a>. You may have never used the command line before. You might not even want to. But I’m here to tell you it’s a smart move.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re an art student. And you just bought an expensive aluminium computer, because that’s part of the deal of being an art student today. What programs are you planning to run on it? Photoshop, Safari… Illustrator and inDesign maybe?</p>

<p>That’s so boring! There’s ways to be vastly more intimate and experimental with your computer, and since you have endeavored to study art and you want to be experimental and intimate with your materials, you better get at it with your computer too!</p>

<p>You couldn’t tell by the glossy graphics, but your Mac runs actually quite an old fashioned system, called Unix. Unix has been around since like forever. Or at least the 1970ies. Unix used to run on big computers in universities and enterprises, but in Mac Os X it has now found it’s way to personal computers.</p>

<p>Because Unix used to be the system that computer scientists and system administrators would run, almost all of the nifty programming tools have been developed for Unix. Your mac comes preinstalled with all the major programming languages: Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP. It comes with the webserver that runs many of the websites on the internet: Apache. And because it is a Unix system, you can easily expand with all the open source software that is being written today.</p>

<p>So here’s a sweet deal: your shiny expensive computer comes with a lot of programs for free, and you didn’t even know about it. Plus, you can tap into all the open source development that is being done right now. So whenever someone writes a new creative, clever or useful open source software tool, you can get that for free too! A whole new world to take in.</p>

<p>Now here’s the catch. Computer programmers and system administrators have a culture all of their own. One of the defining characteristics is, within this culture, graphical user interfaces like your Mac’s windows and buttons are not seen as the easiest way to deal with a program. Rather, you are expected to deal with your program through a <em>Terminal</em>. This is a window in which you type commands. Just like in DOS, for those of you who have used a computer before 1995.</p>

<p>So to benefit from the culture of open source and programming, you have to learn how to use the terminal to run your programs. Other than that, you have to learn to use a program called a ‘package manager’ to easily install new programs. My colleagues are going to learn you both of these things. And to achieve the latter, we’re also going to install a compiler—having a compiler around is an integral part of this lifestyle.</p>

<p>I’ll hand it back to bnf to introduce you to the terminal!</p>

</a> at the Piet Zwart institute, Rotterdam. One of the few master courses <a href="http://river-valley.tv/how-to-run-an-art-school-on-free-and-open-source-software/" title="How to Run an Art School on Free and Open Source Software | River Valley TV">that runs on free and open source software

<p><em>I like tight pants and mathematics.<br/>
Queering up programming culture.</em></p>

<blockquote>To give programming a productive place in your arts and design practice, you need to get to know programming culture, and, ideally, take part in (re)shaping it. To feel comfortable with being a programmer, you might want to change what a programmer is. With queering up I am not referring to homosexuality, but rather to an approach that undermines existing masculine, heteronormative ideals.  An historical example would be Glam rock’s appropriation of the traditional ‘earnest’ masculine rock musician into the polysexual identity mirror palace created by musicians as David Bowie and Freddy Mercury.</blockquote>

<p>The query-response format is wonderful. I amaze students with the whoami command—the computer knows the answer! This gives the impression, to some, that the console allows you to have conversations with your computer.</p>

<p>I do often feel like I am talking to the computer. But when the computer talks balk to me, from time to time the voice of the computer gives way to the voice of the programmer who wrote it. Or at least, my image of this programmer. This is the output of a 7zip command:</p>

Everything is Ok</pre>

<p>I am moved by the program telling me everything is ok. I am not sure if Igor Pavlov meant to give me consolation from the console—after all, the sentence is logically equivalent to ‘there are no errors’. It could be a simple observation.</p>

<p>In any case it’s endearing: I imagine the programmer as a pretty dark-haired boy. He is shy and his eyes that hide already behind large glasses avoid your gaze. And Igor is not so handy with words, but he means good with the world. </p>

<p>But the encounter is not always so nice. The reason I install Fedora is because I have to compile some Perl modules to put on my shared hosting service to make Movable Type work (all of this takes place some time back). The interactive mode of CPAN has the most condescending error messages ever.</p>

<p>Yet nothing beats Telnet. When typing in RCPT: instead of the required RCPT TO: I get:</p>

<pre>Error: I can break rules, too. Goodbye.</pre>

<p>And my connection is closed. I feel like I can actually strangle the programmer responsible for this behaviour. The rude message is a catalyst for my negative passions. I imagine the programmer delighting in his sense of control over me and I want to smash the keyboard on his head.</p>

<p>I project in my mind this monster: crouched behind his computer, staring intently at the screen, a system administrator, overweight and unkempt hair, staring maniacally at the screen, laughing out loud about this error message that is going to upset the people using his code. But I have been awake too long. I made him in my own image; look at me: I’m also alone, staring maniacally at the screen, making up these stories about computer programmers.</p>

<p>With minds so volatile and temperaments so inflammable, it’s important we stay nice to each other. If the only way we talk to each other is through error messages, we better make these exceptionally kind.</p>

<p>I want to learn how to program. Why, that is for another post. But then where to begin. You can’t just learn programming, it seems, you have to pick one among many of programming languages to learn. And each programming language has a corresponding community. And these communities behave like football supporters for their own language. While they would be better pressed to support programming in general ’cause that’s a cause for which many new converts can still be made, and these converts don’t care for the particularities of your language—yet. Anyway, this turns me off.</p>

<p>So this sounds just right:</p>

<blockquote>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about any particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and query systems. To get past generalities you must have programming practice in some particular language, and in this course we use Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. This language is particularly well-suited to the organizing ideas we want to teach. Our hope, however, is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days’ work.</blockquote>

<p class="byline"><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/0.pdf" title="">source</a></p>

<p>I get the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html" title="Structure and Interpretation 
of Computer Programs">big blue book</a>, and I start watching the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/search?cx=005415252586317091923%3Anp2thtbsmyq&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=61a&amp;sa=Search&amp;siteurl=webcast.berkeley.edu%2F" title="UC Berkeley Webcasts | Video and Podcasts: Search Courses and Events">screencasts</a>. Parts of me get stimulated that I had forgotten I have. Like some kind of abstraction gland. It’s pretty nice.</p>

<img src="/and/assets/called/sicp_cover.jpg" style="width:400px;height:579px" alt="You see a blue book cover. The title reads, in white: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Over a read background, in black and white, a woodcut of two people engaged in alchemistic practice. Below, the authors read as Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman" title="" />

<p>But it’s also way too difficult. The way in which Abelson &amp; Sussman explain computation is by consistently comparing it to math. Math is probably a way of thinking in which Science majors are already comfortable. Yet I don’t do math on a regular basis. So it’s like teaching me a language I don’t know by comparing it to another language I don’t really speak either.</p>

<p>A different strategy is needed. I need to work with what I know: words, images. <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" title="Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years">Peter Norvig says</a> to use whatever your friends are using: “The advantage you get from learning from your friends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or between programming languages.” I’m gonna ask my friends to help me get started.</p>

The left hand picture sees him en profil, facing right, with his head turned back towards the camera. The other picture is formal, and in black and white. His head turned slightly to the right, the man looks reserved but seemingly content.</summary>

<p><a href="http://www.stroom.nl/" title="Stroom Den Haag">Stroom</a> is the local arts body in the city I live in. The city is not very big. To keep cultural live vibrant, the city government tries hard to stimulate the art scene, so that not all artists move to more famous cities. As part of this, for the second time I will be part of <a href="http://www.stroom.nl/paginas/pagina.php?pa_id=9842884" title="Stroom Den Haag - Stroom Invest Programma 2011">a program that introduces artists to curators</a>.</p>

<p>I remember the director of Stroom explaining to us, how do we deal with a curator. We should not act too self-assured. Rather, we present an open ended view of our work. Also, we must not expect these curators to make exhibitions with us. We get taught to be subservient.</p>

<p>Well I'd rather be inquisitive. Once again, I'll spend three days talking to art professionals. I'm not going to try and act spontaneous. This time I'll be keeping notes and I'll share them here. I hope we can answer this question: can the world of contemporary art be fixed?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Without having drunk, I praise God.
Today many things happened.<br />
Strolling through the lower city,<br />
thinking of the Final Things,<br />
I saw a boy, presumably a German tourist,<br />
and followed him while I thought:<br />
I'll slap your ass or if that won't work<br />
you can hit me,<br />
the main thing is we're occupied—<br />
until he entered De Bijenkorf and I,<br />
dizzy with horniness, bumping into people,<br />
lost his trail.<br />
Nevertheless I didn't forego praising You.<br />
For unfathomably grand are all your labours:<br />
Thou, who hast made the being<br />
that has a cunt from behind and a tail in front.<br />
Like I said, I hadn't even drunk, and yet I wanted<br />
To honour you weeping and kneel for You in tears,<br />
Oh Master, Slave and Brother, Slaughtered and Risen God.<br />
Humming and secretly prophetising,<br />
I continued on my way.<br />
Then I saw Bet van Beeren, at a little white table<br />
sitting in front of her café, trying with fork and knife<br />
to open up a macrel to eat it in the sun.<br />
I thought look. How beatifully is made everything in Nature.<br />
(Just think about those stars and their lightyears.)<br />
I did want to go to some kind of evening mass,<br />
but there was none.</p>]]>

<p>Reading yet <a href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog" title="About this Blog | Free PeepCode Blog">another programming blog with great design</a>, I feel ashamed for the shape this site is in.</p>

<p>Well, it is in beta! Apparently there are people who can pull it off, but I think my website will be better if I do not develop, design and write it all at the same time.</p>

<p>For the visual identity I am now working with <a href="http://www.mccuskey.nl/" title="Jij &amp; McCuskey">Rowan</a>. I am sure it will turn out wonderful. Stay tuned.</p>]]>
