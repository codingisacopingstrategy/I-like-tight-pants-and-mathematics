<p><a href="http://www.stroom.nl/" title="Stroom Den Haag">Stroom</a> is the local arts body in the city I live in. The city is not very big. To keep cultural live vibrant, the city government tries hard to stimulate the art scene, so that not all artists move to more famous cities. As part of this, for the second time I will be part of <a href="http://www.stroom.nl/paginas/pagina.php?pa_id=9842884" title="Stroom Den Haag - Stroom Invest Programma 2011">a program that introduces artists to curators</a>.</p>

<p>I remember the director of Stroom explaining to us, how do we deal with a curator. We should not act too self-assured. Rather, we present an open ended view of our work. Also, we must not expect these curators to make exhibitions with us. We get taught to be subservient.</p>

<p>Well I'd rather be inquisitive. Once again, I'll spend three days talking to art professionals. I'm not going to try and act spontaneous. This time I'll be keeping notes and I'll share them here. I hope we can answer this question: can the world of contemporary art be fixed?</p>]]>

    <summary>To celebrate Easter I translated Gerard Reve&apos;s (1923-2006) ‘Een Nieuw Paaslied’ (1962): “until he entered De Bijenkorf and I, // dizzy with horniness, bumping into people, // lost his trail.”</summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Without having drunk, I praise God.
Today many things happened.<br />
Strolling through the lower city,<br />
thinking of the Final Things,<br />
I saw a boy, presumably a German tourist,<br />
and followed him while I thought:<br />
I'll slap your ass or if that won't work<br />
you can hit me,<br />
the main thing is we're occupied—<br />
until he entered De Bijenkorf and I,<br />
dizzy with horniness, bumping into people,<br />
lost his trail.<br />
Nevertheless I didn't forego praising You.<br />
For unfathomably grand are all your labours:<br />
Thou, who hast made the being<br />
that has a cunt from behind and a tail in front.<br />
Like I said, I hadn't even drunk, and yet I wanted<br />
To honour you weeping and kneel for You in tears,<br />
Oh Master, Slave and Brother, Slaughtered and Risen God.<br />
Humming and secretly prophetising,<br />
I continued on my way.<br />
Then I saw Bet van Beeren, at a little white table<br />
sitting in front of her café, trying with fork and knife<br />
to open up a macrel to eat it in the sun.<br />
I thought look. How beatifully is made everything in Nature.<br />
(Just think about those stars and their lightyears.)<br />
I did want to go to some kind of evening mass,<br />
but there was none.</p>]]>

<p>Reading yet <a href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog" title="About this Blog | Free PeepCode Blog">another programming blog with great design</a>, I feel ashamed for the shape this site is in.</p>

<p>Well, it is in beta! Apparently there are people who can pull it off, but I think my website will be better if I do not develop, design and write it all at the same time.</p>

<p>For the visual identity I am now working with <a href="http://www.mccuskey.nl/" title="Jij &amp; McCuskey">Rowan</a>. I am sure it will turn out wonderful. Stay tuned.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>An artist statement is a text you write when you apply for a scholarship or open call, and that you keep around on your website.</em></p>

<p>I keep changing around this text. Because I do not know who you are I get no clues as to what I should talk about. I talk in abstractions of meaning, art and revolution.</p> 

<p>You of course stay silent.</p>

<p>I try harder to convince you that my thoughts are interesting and that you should say something back. I even try to convince you that I understand everything.</p>

<p>This, at times is true, and then I always think I must be interesting to talk to. Yet understanding in itself does not amount to much.</p>

<p>Sense we can only make inbetween the both of us.</p>

<p>What I think I am actually saying is: I would like you to talk to me. That would be good. You can call or mail me, and we will meet and talk. Or just look out of the window together, which is even better.</p>

<p>There is a second message. Which is: let us mount shows with my pictures. I would like that.</p>]]>

    <summary>My strongest first impression was the sense of confrontation that was instigated, not in the content per se but as evident from the two questions (…). The stance is important, and even political. It reminds me of feminism. And I suppose its the direct reply to that “geeky” fear we have.</summary>
