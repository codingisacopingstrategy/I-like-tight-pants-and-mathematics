*I like tight pants and mathematics*

This is a blog. On git to enable collaboration between contributors.

Movable type handles comments etc. We hope to edit the pages via the 
filesystem, than feed the changes back into MT using XML-RPC, filtering out the 
relevant sections using XPath.

Licensing will be a mess: probably a mix between copyright, copyleft and public 
domain licensing, depending on the nature of the material and the contributors.

Thanks for reading, E.
